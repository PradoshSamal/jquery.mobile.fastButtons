This jQuery Mobile plugin makes click events faster, especially iOS.  By default, the 'click' event is used.  This event has a significant delay in iOS in order to distinguish it from other events.  In native apps, however, clicking a button happens significantly faster.  So, this plugin simply replaces 'click' events on document with jQueryMobile's 'vclick'.


Usage:

Simply include this file after jQueryMobile.
